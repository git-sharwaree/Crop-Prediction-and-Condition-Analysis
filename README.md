# 🌿 Crop Prediction and Condition Analysis

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to support **precision farming** by recommending the most suitable crop based on **soil and environmental parameters**. It also analyzes the **ideal growing conditions** for various crop varieties, offering data-driven insights for improved agricultural decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- 🔍 Predict the most appropriate crop based on given environmental and soil data.
- 📊 Analyze optimal growing conditions such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil nutrients (N, P, K).
- ⚙️ Compare two machine learning approaches to determine the most reliable and accurate solution.

---

## 🛠️ Implementation

Two modeling approaches were explored:

### 1️⃣ Multiclass Classification for Crop Recommendation  
Trained a classification model using:
- Rainfall  
- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)

✅ Achieved **96.8% accuracy** using scikit-learn with proper model tuning.

### 2️⃣ Reverse Modeling for Ideal Conditions  
Built a model to predict the **ideal environmental conditions** required for a given crop.  
While informative, this approach was **less accurate** than the crop classification model.

**📌 Conclusion:** The **classification model** performed significantly better for the task of crop prediction.
