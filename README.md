# _project title_- crop prediction and condition analysis
# _objectives_-
   This project aims to aid **Precision Farming** by predicting the most suitable crops based on environmental and soil conditions.The project seeks to analyze the ideal environmental conditions for each crop variety, providing insights into factors that significantly influence crop performance.

# _Implementation_-
The project leverages multiclass classification techniques to predict the best-suited crop for given soil and climate parameters. Two approaches were explored: the first approach, using multiclass classification models, demonstrated higher accuracy in predicting crops based on rainfall, temperature, humidity, and soil nutrient levels. The second approach involved training the model to identify optimal growing conditions for specific crops.On comparing both the models,it was determined that the classification model provided better results for crop prediction.
